**Whoups! You are a little early. This is going to be an npm package. So
hold tight** ğŸ™ƒ

Example `config.json` file

```
{
  "ci": "https://jenkins",
  "whitelist": [ "pattern1", "pattern2" ],
  "filter": [ "pattern2" ]
}
```

---

Build the package with `yarn build`, add `config.json`
and start server with `yarn server`
