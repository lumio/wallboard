=========

**Hello there ðŸ˜Š you are a little early. This README is not finished yet, as
this package is still in beta.**

What is **wallboard**? This is a simple build status server, showing builds from
a specified Jenkins server.

Currently only Jenkins is supported. If you wish to have support for a specific
CI/CD, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/lumio/wallboard/issues/1).
