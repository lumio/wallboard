**Whoups! You are a little early. This is going to be an npm package. So
hold tight** ðŸ™ƒ

Example `config.json` file

```
{
  "ci": "https://jenkins",
  "whitelist": "keyword1|keyword2",
  "filter": "keyword1|keyword2"
}
```

Build the package with `yarn build`, add `config.json`
and start server with `yarn server`
